# Blender Animation Manager

A Blender add-on for efficiently managing animations, including action selection, NLA operations, deletion, and batch renaming, all from a user-friendly interface.

## Project Story

The *Animation Manager* add-on was developed using AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude. Without any prior programming experience, I described the functionality I wanted in plain language, and these AI tools helped generate the code. This project is a testament to how AI can assist in software development, even for complete beginners.

Feel free to use the add-on, suggest improvements, or contribute to its growth!
