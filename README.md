# Blender Animation Manager (for blender 3.6)

A Blender add-on for efficiently managing animations, including action selection, NLA operations, deletion, and batch renaming, all from a user-friendly interface.

## Project Story

The *Animation Manager* add-on was created to simplify animation workflows in Blender. It provides intuitive tools for selecting, renaming, and managing actions, as well as pushing animations to the Non-Linear Animation (NLA) editor. Whether you need to batch rename multiple actions or delete unnecessary ones, this add-on offers a user-friendly interface to streamline your work.

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude, turning descriptions of functionality into code. While the add-on was built using AI support, the focus is entirely on providing an efficient solution for managing animations in Blender.

Feel free to explore, use the add-on, suggest improvements, or contribute to its development!
